## email addresses matching these won't get filtered when importing
# email_filter_exclusions:
# - !ruby/regexp /@example.com/
# - test@example.com
# 
## when filtering email addresses this is what to replace them with
## so foo@example.net would become bar+foo.example.net@example.com 
# filtered_email_address:
# - bar+{{filtered_email}}@example.com
